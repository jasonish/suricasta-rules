# Suricasta Rule Manager

A minimal Suricata Rule Manager written in Rust.

The main purpose of this rule manager is to provide a minimal viable
rule manager so I can work with Suricata on Windows

Any resemblance to Suricata Update is coincidental, but I am trying to
keep it familiar and somewhat compatible for now.

## Notice

Do not become dependent on this repo. It could be consumed by one of
my other projects such as EveBox, EveCtl... Or maybe become the new
Suricata-Update?
